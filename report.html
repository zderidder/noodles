					<h2>Create a website for a client</h2>
					<p>Our client can be anyone interested in eating, cooking, or learning about a variety of noodles in the Eau-Claire area.</p>
				</li>

				<li class="topic">
					<h2>Include headers</h2>
					<p>The above text is a header type, and the text at the very top of the page is a style of header as well as a header type.</p>
				</li>

				<li class="topic">
					<h2>Include Navigation Links</h2>
					<p>Our navbar is a set of links to navigate the website. These links lead to a few key pages on our website.</p>
				</li>

				<li class="topic">
					<h2>Distinct layouts for large/small screens</h2>
					<p>Our website uses media queries to resize, and grids become one column when shrunk to the size of a phone.</p>
				</li>

				<li class="topic">
					<h2>Consistent style across pages</h2>
					<p>We have a style.css folder that is linked on all pages, and this styles everything but the main content of the page. For the main content, we use the same color scheme and general layout across our pages.</p>
				</li>

				<li class="topic">
					<h2>Include images with proper alt descriptions</h2>
					<p>We have a header image on most pages, and images on the restaurants page. These images all have a short but accurate description.</p>
				</li>

				<li class="topic">
					<h2>Declare a favicon</h2>
					<p>We use the same favicon across all pages, as it fits the general website pretty well.</p>
				</li>

				<li class="topic">
					<h2>Organize the non-HTML resources</h2>
					<p>We use an <b>images</b> folder for all of our images, and a <b>css</b> folder for all of our stylesheets.</p>
				</li>

				<li class="topic">
					<h2>Do not use libraries or frameworks</h2>
					<p>We designed everything on the page based on concepts from class or our own knowledge.</p>
				</li>

				<li class="topic">
					<h2>Each page and stylesheet must validate using html/css checkers</h2>
					<p>We ran every page and stylesheet through the listed validation services.</p>
				</li>

				<li class="topic">
					<h2>The site could be stored using GitHub</h2>
					<p>We did, and it can be found <a href="https://github.com/kamrowcj0380/CS-268---Noodles-Website">here</a>.</p>
				</li>

				<li class="topic">
					<h2>File names should be lowercase and alphanumeric</h2>
					<p>Our file names are things such as index.html and style.css, which follow these guidelines.</p>
				</li>

				<li class="topic">
					<h2>Align content neatly with clearly defined axes</h2>
					<p>Pages have a clear line on either end of the main content where there is a margin, and other styling makes use of grids to clearly define the elements.</p>
				</li>

				<li class="topic">
					<h2>Make use of multiple font faces</h2>
					<p>It isn't easy to notice due to the similar font, but the very top of the page has a header with a unique font.</p>
				</li>

				<li class="topic">
					<h2>Include links to external sites that open in a new window</h2>
					<p>We have links on our restaurant and recipe pages that open in new windows.</p>
				</li>

				<li class="topic">
					<h2>Code must be readable, using both conventional formatting and meaningful id/class names</h2>
					<p>We use proper indentation across pages, and our ids are things like "navbar" and classes are things like "navbar_text".</p>
				</li>

				<li class="topic">
					<h2>Include a consistent navbar</h2>
					<p>The navbar has a style that is used on various pages, and it appears on every page in the same way with the same style.</p>
				</li>

				<li class="topic">
					<h2>Include a header and footer section</h2>
					<p>Along with the navbar, the header and footer are both included on this page. The header is the text with the red background, and the footer is at the bottom with the lighter background than the main color of the page.</p>
				</li>

				<li class="topic">
					<h2>Use flexboxes and/or grids</h2>
					<p>The navbar at the top of the page was implemented using display:grid; in "style.css".</p>
					<p>index.html and fun_facts.html both use a flexbox layout for information lower on the page</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
			
			<div class="topic">
				<h2>Feedback from client</h2>
				<p>The website overall is exquisite. The navigation bar towards the top of the page especially is quite divine. Only critique I have is that the google map links for the addresses of the noodle shops is the same font as the rest of the page.</p>

				<ul>
					<li>about.html</li>
					<p>Connor - Wrote personal paragraph about myself, all style was created together</p>
					<p>Zach - </p>
					<li>common.html</li>
					<p>Connor - I moved most of the standard stuff from the pages into this for other pages to inherit, but it all uses codes from previous pages. I created the grid to display the image and the text at the top</p>
					<p>Zach - </p>
					<li>contact_us.html</li>
					<p>Connor - I created the style for the form itself, and implemented it</p>
					<p>Zach - </p>
					<li>fried.html, soup.html, pasta.html</li>
					<p>Connor - These all use the same grid layout for recipes, and were filled out with some information found on the various linked websites</p>
					<p>Zach - </p>
					<li>fun_facts.html</li>
					<p>Connor - I made the fun facts flexbox layout, and displayed a random fun fact from the database</p>
					<p>Zach - </p>
					<li>history.html</li>
					<p>Connor - This only uses style.css information, and then the page was filled in. I did probably half of the page, and Zach did the other half</p>
					<p>Zach - </p>
					<li>homemade.html</li>
					<p>Connor - Almost the exact same as the pages it links to, but I added the individual divs with the topic class for each link</p>
					<p>Zach - </p>
					<li>index.html</li>
					<p>Connor - Nothing</p>
					<p>Zach - </p>
					<li>restaurants.html</li>
					<p>Connor - Nothing</p>
					<p>Zach - </p>
					<li>submitted.html</li>
					<p>Connor - I created the CSS animation, and the flask code to return the user to the link given as a parameter</p>
					<p>Zach - </p>
